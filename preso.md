# What is Devops

---

# Folk Models

* general popularly understood meaning particular to a socio-cultural grouping but which has not been formally defined or standardized.

---
# Why Devops?

---
# High Performing Devops Teams
# are more agile
## 30X more frequent deployments
## 8000X faster lead times than peers

2014 PuppetLabs State of DevOps Survey

---
# High Performing Devops Teams
# are more reliable
## 2X change success rate
## 12X faster mean time to recovery (MTTR)

# Five Pillars of Effective Devops

* Collaboration
* Hiring
* Affinity
* Tools
* Scaling

---

# Collaboration

* Individuals Working Together

---

# Hiring

* Choosing Individuals

---

# Affinity

* From Individuals to Teams

---

# Tools

* Choosing and Using them

---

# Scaling

* Growing and Decreasing 

---

# Collaboration and Tools

^ Not enough time to cover all pillars. Not enough time to go into great depth which is why we are writing a book! We're going to focus on elements of collaboration and tools today. We'll be doing "Hiring and Tools" at Velocity NY.

---

# The Devops Compact

* shared mutual understanding
* established boundaries

# Stormtrooper Syndrome

* Agency
* Adaptability: Role adherence

---

# Learned Helplessness

^ When people are conditioned through environment that they have no control, will not act to change condition.


---

> A life becomes meaningful when one sees himself or herself as an actor within the context of a story.

-- George Howard

^ Work is meaningful when people see themselves as active participants. Sharing story is critical part of building resilience. 

---

# Swift Trust

* skillful self disclosure
 * what you share, how you share it
 * collective tasks vs personal agendas

---

# Team

* common purpose 
* defined beliefs
* empowered

---

# Small vs Large teams

* large teams - roles may be highly segregated 
* small teams - one person may be responsible for many roles

---

# Cultivating Empathy

* Collect stories 
* Listen 
* Circle back

---

# Smarter Teams Build Better Value[^1]

* Lots of Communication
* Contribute equally to team's discussions
* Theory of Mind
* Increased diversity

# Critical habits for teams

* Code Review
* Pairing

---

# Code Review

* max 90 minutes in one setting

---

# Pairing

* agile software development
* 2 people work together on 1 workstation
* driver - writes code
* observer - reviews each line
* roles switch frequently

---

# Types of Pairing

* expert-expert
* expert-novice
* novice-novice

^ When experts pair, work gets done quickly, new innovation not always obtained, depending on skill overlap because not questioning accepted standards of doing things.

^ When expert and novice pair, can be very good or very bad. if expert isn't patient and does all the typing, novice learns helplessness and slow to get anything done. if expert is patient can involve growth for both as novice helps expert to question standards.

^ When novices pair, can work together to learn and achieve more than a novice working on their own. If no understanding in pair, and fire-fighting schedules can lead to poor practices implemented into production higher technical debt.

4 types of cards

* goal - pink
* keeper - green played in front of you
* action - blue used once and discarded
* rule - yellow 

![fit](http://www.looneylabs.com/sites/default/files/Fluxx5.0_3D-Contents-hires.jpg)

---

# Fluxx - On your turn

* Draw the number of cards currently required.
* Play the number of cards currently required.
* Discard down to hand limit (if any hand limit).

## Impact on Quality
* Service quality (SLAs)
* Visibility of quality

---

# Statsd

---
```
>>> import statsd
>>>
>>> timer = statsd.Timer('MyApplication')
>>>
>>> timer.start()
>>> # do something here
>>> timer.stop('SomeTimer')
```
---

```
>>> import statsd
>>>
>>> counter = statsd.Counter('MyApplication')
>>> # do something here
>>> counter += 1
```
---

```
>>> import statsd
>>>
>>> average = statsd.Average('MyApplication', connection)
>>> # do something here
>>> average.send('SomeName', 'somekey:%d'.format(value))
```

# Graphite

---

# Value of Change

---

## Value of Availability

* Better for customers
* Better for employees (internal services)
* Fewer pages

---

## Value of Quality

* Deploys take less time
* Also better for customers
* More visibility into issues
